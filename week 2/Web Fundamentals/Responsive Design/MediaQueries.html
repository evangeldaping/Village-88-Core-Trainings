<!-- @media
CSS uses the @media rule to detect information about the device being used to access the website. For example, it can be
used to detect the size of the device, its capabilities, and its orientation. For this course, we will be using it to
detect the device size, but keep in mind that it is capable of much more.

Different devices
We have three basic categories of devices: phones, tablets, and desktops. Of course there are more, but these are the
big three. We will focus on using media queries to detect which category of device is being used and respond
appropriately. To do this, we’ll need to know how we define each of these categories.

Device Size
Phone Width less than or equal to 480px
Tablet Width between 481px and 1023px
Desktop Width greater than or equal to 1024px


Flexible units
Responsive web design is all about making our website fluid and proportional, so sometimes it doesn't make sense to make
elements on the page have a fixed size in pixels. We'll still use pixels - for example, we usually use pixels for
padding, since we typically want the same amount of padding regardless of screen size - but now we will also use
flexible units for the elements on the page that need to be fluid. For example, we can use percentage (%) to set an
element to take a certain amount of the available width, and the available width is determined by screen size! Other
flexible units include em and rem. The rem unit is a multiplier of the default font size of the user's browser. The em
unit is a multiplier of the element's parent. Experiment with these different units to understand how they behave.

Example
Let's say that we have four buttons on our website that we would like to change color depending on the size of the
screen. We'll give desktop users red buttons, tablet users blue buttons, and phone users yellow buttons. We'll give the
buttons the class of .navbtn.

To get you started, here's how we would set up a media query in our CSS to notice if the user's screen is 480 px wide or
smaller. If this is true, then we will target all elements with the class .navbtn and set their background to be yellow.

@media only screen and (max-width: 480px){
/* we will set these stylings only if the device is a screen with a width of 480px or less */
.navbtn {
background-color: yellow;
}
}
Remember that CSS is read from top to bottom, so if the conditions of the media query are met, the stylings within could
override any stylings you placed on .navbtn in the code above the media query. Any code that you write below the media
query may override the stylings we did here.

Try changing the button colors from red to blue to yellow on your own, depending on screen size. Rewatch the video above
if you need a hint. Then, change how the buttons are oriented depending on screen size.

For desktop users, arrange all four buttons in one line
For tablet users, place two buttons per line
For phone users, give each button its own line -->
