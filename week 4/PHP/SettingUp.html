        There are some important settings that we want to make sure we have before we get started with the PHP basics. The
        instructions for what is done in the video are below.
        
        1. Locate your httpd.conf file and set a Document Root (allows us to manually set a folder we want to serve website files
            like PHP)
            WAMP
                Click on the WAMP Server icon on the bottom right
        
        
                Go to Apache
                Click on httpd.conf. If you are having trouble opening httpd.conf, you might need to manually navigate to the file
                through Windows Explorer and open it with Sublime or your favorite text editor.
        
                Look for DocumentRoot and set it to the directory you want to serve files
            MAMP
                Open MAMP and click on Preferences
                Click the Apache(Webserver) tab and set it to the directory you want to serve files from.
        2. Restart your Apache server.
        3. Navigate to the Document Root directory that you just set.
        4. Create a file in that directory called info.php and place the following inside:
            <?php
            echo phpinfo();
            ?>
        
        5. Navigate to that file in your browser by going to http://localhost/info.php
        6. Locate the Loaded Configuration File to see where your php.ini configuration file is.
        7. Open up that file in a text editor and make the following changes.
            Find the setting for display_errors and make sure that it is set to On.
            Find zend_extension and make sure it is not commented out (remove the semicolon in front of it).
            Find html_errors and make sure it is set to On.
            NOTE: If you are using php version 5.5.3 or higher; Find opcache.revalidate_freq and set the value to 0.
        8. If you change the display_errors value, you have to restart Apache for changes to take effect.
