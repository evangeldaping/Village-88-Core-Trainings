        <ol>
            <li>What's the query for creating this new database table with the fields above?
                <img src="./Answers/1.png" alt="create new database">
            </li>
            <li>What's the query for inserting new records into this table? Write queries for inserting three fake users into the table
                (one query for each insert).

                <img src="./Answers/2-b.png" alt="insert new records">
            </li>
            <li>What's the query for updating one of the user records? For example, if you wanted to update the user record for id = 1,
                with some fake data, what would the query be?
                <img src="./Answers/3.png" alt="update user records">
            </li>
            <li>What query would you run for updating all of the user records with the last_name of 'Choi'?
                <img src="./Answers/4.png" alt="update all user records with the last_name of 'Choi'">
            </li>
            <li>What query would you run for updating all the user records where ID is 3, 5, 7, 12, or 19?
                <img src="./Answers/5.png" alt="updating all the user records where ID is 3, 5, 7, 12, or 19">
            </li>
            <li>What's the query for deleting a user record where id = 1?
                <img src="./Answers/6.png" alt="deleting a user record where id = 1">
            </li>
            <li>What's the query for deleting the entire users records in the users table?
                <img src="./Answers/7.png" alt="deleting the entire users records in the users table">
            </li>
            <li>What's the query for dropping the entire users table? What's the difference between dropping the table and deleting all
                records?
                <img src="./Answers/8.png"
                    alt="difference between dropping and deleting all records">
                    <p>Drop Table will totally delete the table and its records while Delete Table will just delete the records only.</p>
            </li>
            <li>What's the query for altering the email field to have it be 'email_address' instead?
                <img src="./Answers/9.png" alt="email to email_address">
            </li>
            <li>What's the query for altering the id so that it's a BIGINT instead?
                <img src="./Answers/10.png" alt="id to have BIGINT value">
            </li>
            <li>What's the query for adding a new field to the users table called is_active where it's a Boolean (meaning it's either a
                0 or a 1). Imagine you wanted the default value of this to be 0 when a new record is created and you won't allow this
                field to ever be NULL. With this in mind, now come up with a query.
                <img src="./Answers/11.png" alt="is_active with boolean datatype set to 0 default value">
            </li>
        </ol>
