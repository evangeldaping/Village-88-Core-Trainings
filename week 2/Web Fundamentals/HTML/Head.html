This is the opening head tag which indicates that we are about to begin talking about the properties of the
document.

Meta Tags
Meta tags make your web page more meaningful for search engines like Google.

The attribute content of the description meta tag describes the basic purpose of your web page (a summary of what
the web page contains). For each web page, you should place a concise and relevant summary in this section.

For example, this description:
<title>Coding Dojo: Coding Bootcamp in Seattle and San Francisco</title>
<meta name="description"
    content="Coding Dojo Founder, Michael Choi, developed and refined the dynamic learning curriculum after years of hands-on experience as an executive in fast growing...">
<br>

The "Coding Dojo: Coding Bootcamp in Seattle and San Francisco" comes from the <title> tag.

<meta charset="utf-8">
Properly encoded Web pages declare the encoding to a browser through a meta tag in the header. Without this tag, a
browser may not know to switch to the proper encoding and characters may be displayed as gibberish.

<title>My Awesome Webpage</title>
This is the title of your web page, which means that when you open this page in the browser, the tab that opens it
will read "My Awesome Webpage". This will be the name that it gets bookmarked with, as well as the name that is used
when it is displayed as a search result in a search engine.

<meta name="description" content="description content">
The description meta tag is used by search engines when displaying results.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="my_css_file.css">
This line links a stylesheet to our page, which will determine how our HTML elements are visually displayed on the
page. We will learn more about what goes into my_css_file.css in the CSS section.

<script src="my_javascript_library.js"></script>
This line links a JavaScript or jQuery file to our document. JavaScript makes our pages interactive. We will learn
more about these files in the jQuery section.

NOTE: You can link to as many stylesheets or JavaScript files as you want within the head tags.

This is the closing head tag. It indicates that we are done talking about the properties of our page and we can move
on to the body! -->
