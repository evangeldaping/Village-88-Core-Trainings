    Objects
    A variable type that we haven't used very much yet is a type called Objects. In other programming languages, this is
    often called as an associative array, hash, or a dictionary. In Javascript, it's simply called as Objects.
    
    An object has a key value pair. For example:
    
    var teacher = { name: 'Michael', city: 'Seattle', state: 'Washington' };
    We can access each value by doing:
    
    console.log( teacher.name );
    console.log( teacher.city );
    We can update the value by doing:
    
    teacher.city = 'Bellevue';
    console.log( teacher.city ); //this will now log Bellevue
    You could even create a new key/value by adding a new property. For example:
    
    teacher.favorite_sport = "soccer";
    console.log(teacher); //this would now log all the key values storied in the variable teacher
    An Array of Objects
    It's also very common to have a variable be an array of multiple objects. For example,
    
    var students = [ { name: "John", age: 25 },
    { name: "KB", age: 21 },
    { name: "Jomar", age: 25 } ];
    If you wanted to loop through this array and print each value in the object, you could do something like this:
    
    for(var i=0; i<students.length; i++){ console.log( "Student Name: " + students[i].name + " - Age: " + students[i].age);
        } You could alternatively, do something like this also: for(student of students){ console.log( "Student Name: " +
        student.name + " - Age: " + student.age); }
