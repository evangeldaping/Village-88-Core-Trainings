<!-- Sometimes we want to GROUP multiple records to produce some interesting insight.

For example, imagine that you ran the following query in the world database.

SELECT name, continent, population, life_expectancy
FROM world.countries
ORDER BY continent ASC;
This query generates a result that looks like this.


Now, if I asked you to come up with the following, how would you obtain the answers?

Get the number of countries in each continent. For example, how many countries are there in Asia, Europe, etc?
For each continent, what's the total population?
For each continent, what's the average life expectancy?
Note that to get an answer to the first question, you looked at the results and COUNTED the number of records for each
continent?

For the 2nd question, you probably looked at all the countries for say 'Asia', and got the SUM of all the population for
'Asia'.

For the 3rd question, you probably looked at all the countries for say 'Asia', and got the AVERAGE of all the population
for 'Asia.

Whenever you have multiple records and you're combining the multiple records into a single record, you can use these
aggregate function to obtain some valuable data.

The art of self checking
Too often, developers use aggregative functions to create a summary record but do not check the data themselves to see
if the returned data is accurate.

You should not do this but every time you're about to use an aggregate function,

Do NOT use an aggregate function just yet
Retrieve all records and manually calculate what some of the summary results should be (e.g. sum, count, average, or
other value for the record you're expecting to get)
Use an aggregate function and then compare the sample result with what you've calculated manually above
What you should not do is

Use an aggregate function
Assume that what you got was the correct value
Sometimes, with complex queries, especially with lots of join statements and other complex behavior, without manually
checking some sample data, you will get some weird output that may easily go un-noticed and be used for generating some
important reports. An experienced developer always verifies whether they are doing the join statements correctly, check
the records first, analyze some data to see what the expected aggregate value would be for a specific field, add the
aggregate function, and then verify that the aggregate function indeed returned the value one was expecting. -->
