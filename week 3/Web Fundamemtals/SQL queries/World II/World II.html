                <img src="./Answers/5.png" alt="top 10 countries with the most populatione">
            </li>
            <li>According to the world database, how many people are there in the world?

            <li>Show results for continents where it shows the continent name and the total population. Only show results where the
            total_population for the continent is more than 500,00,000. If. the continent doesn't have 500,000,000 people, do NOT
            show the result.
                <img src="./Answers/7.png" alt="Only show results where the
            total_population for the continent is more than 500,00,000. If. the continent doesn't have 500,000,000 people, do NOT

            </li>
            <li>Show results of all continents that has average life expectancy for the continent to be less than 71. Show each of these
                continent name, how many countries there are in each of the continent, total population for the continent, as well as
                the life expectancy of this continent. For example, as Europe and North America both have continent life expectancy
                greater than 71, these continents shouldn't show up in your sql results.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    For the average life expectancy, for simplicity, just assume that you can use the AVG aggregate function. To compute the
                    true average life expectancy, we would need to do something slightly more advanced, but for now, just assume that you
                    can use the AVG function for now.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now that you've used the group by a bit, let's now have you use this together with other records that were joined from
                    multiple tables.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now, write a SQL query to obtain answers to the following questions:
                </li>
                <ol>
                    <li>How many cities are there for each of the country? Show the total city count for each country where you display the full
                        country name.

                    <li>For each language, find out how many countries use that language as the official language.

                            alt="find out how many countries use that language as the official language">
                    </li>
                    <li>For each continent, find out how many cities there are (according to this database) and the average population of the
                        cities for each continent. For example, for continent A, have it state the number of cities for that continent, and the
                        average city population for that continent.
