<!-- What is the HTML PCS Relationship?
The PCS relationship is just a term to describe the relationship between tags/elements inside an HTML document. To know
the relationship between tags, we must first determine the parents, children, and siblings within our HTML document.

Example: -->

<!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title> Hello World! </title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1> Here is a heading tag </h1>
    <p> Now a paragraph tag </p>
</body>

</html> -->

<!-- From the HTML above you can read:

<html> is the root element
<html> has no parents
<html> is the parent of

<head> and

<body>

<head> is the first child of <html>

<body> is the last child of <html>
and:

<head> has one child: <title>
<title> has one content (text): "Hello World!"

<body> has two children: <h1> and <p>
<h1> has one content (text): "Here is a heading tag"
<p> has one content (text): "Now a paragraph tag"
<h1> and <p> are siblings

<head> and

<body> are siblings

Is it really required to indent HTML code?
It's not required, but it is highly recommended, and here are the reasons why:

Beautiful-looking code can make you happy, and one way to make them look beautiful is to properly indent them.
Properly indented code leads to less time spent on troubleshooting. Imagine being stuck with a problem, and you curse
the inventor of HTML (damn you, Tim Berners-Lee!) -- only to find out that you just missed a closing tag. You were not
able to quickly see it because you did not properly indent!
It's easy to browse through your own code. With a glance, you know right away which part is the header part, and which
part is the footer.
It's a good coding habit. Popular programming languages such as PHP, Java, or Ruby recommend proper code indentation.
Python even enforces it.
How to Indent
Just tap the TAB key. 1 TAB is equal to 4 spaces. Some people like 2 spaces and you can change this option with your
favorite text editor, but we recommend tabs, not spaces.
