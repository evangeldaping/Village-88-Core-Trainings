    EcmaScript (ES) is a standardized scripting language for Javascript (JS). Most browsers released after 2012/2013 support
    ES5. ES6, also called ECMAScript 2015, is a newer version that are supported by major browser released after 2016-2017.
    ES6 introduces some significant changes to how developers code in Javascript.
    
    For you, you need to understand both ES5 and ES6. A lot of code you'll see will be built in ES5, especially if the
    code-base was initially built a few years ago.
    
    For this course, we'll focus initially on ES5 syntaxes and introduce ES6 syntaxes in a bit, after Object Oriented
    Programming concepts are introduced.
    
    ES5
    The courses at Hacker Hero were mostly done using ES5 syntaxes. Although ES6 has a lot of additional features, for now,
    we'll have you focus on just a few ES6 features for now.
    
    Remember that in Javascript, the core building blocks are done with the following syntaxes:
    
    1. Variables
    var a = 5; // for storing a number in a variable
    var b = "hello world"; //for storing a string in a variable
    var c = [1,3,5,7,8]; //for storing an array in a variable
    2. If/Else Statements
    if( ...condition... ) {
    // codes that should be executed if the condition is true
    }
    else if( ...condition... ) {
    // codes that should be executed if the second condition is true
    }
    else {
    ...
    }
    3. For loops
    for(var i=0; i<10; i++){ console.log(i); //prints a number from 0 to 9 } 4. Functions function abc(x, y, z){ ... return
        x+y+z; }
