<!-- Note that in this video, I also talk about how you can set up different user access within a SQL database with limited
security scope (for example a user account with only select access, etc).

Insert Statement
To add a new record in the database table, you would use a format such as this:

INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

Update statement
Updating an existing record in the database table, a general format is:

UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
If the condition is not specified, the query could update all records in the table! Therefore, be careful and double
check your where statement before running any update query.

Delete statement
A delete statement, although not used as much as the other statements above, it's still essential to know. The general
format is as follows:

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
