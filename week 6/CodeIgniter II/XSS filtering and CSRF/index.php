    <!-- XSS Filtering and CSRF
    Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability found in a lot of web applications. Spend up to 30 minutes to learn more about this including going through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting.

    Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is another common security vulnerability found in a lot of web applications. Spend up to 30 minutes to learn more about this including going through https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery.

    Now, most frameworks have tools to prevent your site from being attacked with CSS and CSRF. For CodeIgniter, see how this is done by reading: https://codeigniter.com/userguide3/libraries/security.html

    Going forward, for all CodeIgniter projects, make sure your application is secure from these two common attacks. -->
