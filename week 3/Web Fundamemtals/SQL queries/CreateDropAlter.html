<!-- There are also SQL queries to create a database or a table, drop a database or a table, or alter the structure of a
table. These queries are not used as frequently as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT but it would still be good for you
to be familiar with these queries.

Most of the time, these queries are generated using a GUI (Graphical User Interface) and where queries are automatically
generated by these programs. As such, developers rarely have to run these directly, but it would still be good to get
familiar with these queries so that you know how they look like.

Create database
To create a new database named 'databasename', you simply run the following query:

CREATE DATABASE databasename;
Drop database
To drop or remove a database, you do:

DROP DATABASE databasename;
Create a table
To create a new table, you do:

CREATE TABLE table_name (
column1 datatype,
column2 datatype,
column3 datatype,
....
);
For example, to create a table called 'Users' that contain: id, first_name, last_name, email_address, description,
created_at, updated_at, you would run

CREATE TABLE users (
id int,
first_name varchar(255),
last_name varchar(255),
email_address varchar(255),
description TEXT,
created_at DATETIME,
updated_at DATETIME
);
To see different datatypes available, you can see: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_datatypes.asp

Note that based on which SQL database you're using (MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, etc), as well as which version you're
using, different data types are supported. The most frequent and important datatypes you should be familiar with are:

VARCHAR(size)
TINYTEXT, TEXT, MEDIUMTEXT, LONGTEXT
TINYINT, INT, BIGINT, FLOAT, DOUBLE
DATE, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP
Note that SQLserver, Microsoft Access, and other engines support most of these datatypes above but where it may be named
slightly differently. -->
