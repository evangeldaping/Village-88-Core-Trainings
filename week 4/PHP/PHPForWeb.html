        <!-- PHP for Web
        Now that you know how to build web pages with HTML and how to make interactive elements using CSS and jQuery, let's now
        learn how to make our web pages useful using PHP!
        
        PHP not only makes websites useful, it also allows you to work with information stored in a database, like MySQL. PHP is
        the intermediary between text files (HTML) and data (MySQL). If you want to write information to a database, we use PHP.
        If you want to retrieve information out from the database and display it an HTML level for users to see, we use PHP.
        
        Why PHP?
        PHP is a server-side language, and this means that whatever code you write in PHP won't be available for the public
        (client) to view. If a user visits your website and tries to view your codes, they can only see HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript, not PHP. This means we can write PHP code but still hide important data, allowing us to do sensitive tasks
        like accepting Credit Card information and storing user passwords!
        
        Well-known websites that use PHP:
        
        Facebook
        Yahoo
        WordPress
        Wikipedia
        How Does PHP Work
        
        The browser can only interpret HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Therefore, we can look at PHP as a tool to help us populate the
        HTML page with content and even HTML!
        
        Client Side vs Server Side
        Because PHP can't be interpreted by the browser it has to be interpreted somewhere. PHP gets interpreted on the server
        side, or 'back end'. The server is just a computer program that runs on a particular machine and serves files that are
        requested. When you navigate to a web page from your browser, for example www.mysite.com, the browser makes a request to
        the server. On the server side, if the requested page is a PHP file ending with a .php, the server will then process the
        PHP code contained within it. Once the server finishes processing the PHP code and assuming that there are no errors, it
        will then output the result to the page, along with all other content such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        
        
        
        Dynamic vs Static Pages
        What you have learned so far is building static web pages using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. This means that the content you
        write stays that way until you make some changes to it. If you plan on creating a feature that greets users whenever
        they visit your site, it would be impossible to build if you only knew HTML, CSS, and jQuery because you don't have any
        means of knowing each person who visited your site, and even if you do, you would have to keep on modifying the HTML
        file for each user!
        
        PHP doesn't work that way. PHP has the capability of capturing data and automatically put those data on your page.
        Example:
        
        <?php echo "Hello, $name!"; ?>
        /* Where $name is just a variable that can be anything depending on user's input. */
        When user inputs "Tony", our page greets Tony back with:
        
        Hello, Tony ! -->
    </main>
