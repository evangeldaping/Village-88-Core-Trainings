CSS3


CSS3 is a series of modules that are designed to be implemented separately and independently from each other. Although
there are parts of CSS3 that are not yet implemented in any browser, this doesn't mean we can't be using CSS3 today. We
can start using portions of it today as long as we know when and how to add it in.

We can group our website's visual elements into two categories: critical and non-critical. Visual elements that are
critical include branding, usability, accessibility and layout. Visual elements that are non-critical include
interaction, visual rewards, feedback, and movement. We have to make sure we apply CSS3 to non-critical areas because it
will be risky to use CSS3 on critical areas. CSS3 is the cherry on top. We will be going over a small set of CSS3
properties that have reached enough browser support to be usable right now.

First Child, Last Child, nth Child
Given

<body>
    <p>hello</p>
    <div>
        <p>dojo</p>
    </div>
</body>
How would you select just the first paragraph and not the secondary paragraph that's inside the division? Please see:

Some students were asked this during their interviews. In the real world, if a website uses first child, second child,
or nth Child to style the website, it may look nice on the first CSS version but as the website evolves and new contents
are added, maintaining the site using these CSS elements become more cumbersome than needed. Most professionals
therefore don't rely too heavily on these elements and use these sparingly. However, as these are shown in other
tutorials and as other developers may like using these, it's still good to know what these are and how to use them when
needed.

Box Shadow
With box-shadow property, you can add shadow to an element with options for the direction, the amount of blur, and color
of the shadow. You can learn more about box-shadow here.

.awesome {
-webkit-box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #333;
-moz-box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #333;
box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #333;
}
Opacity
With opacity property, you can define how opaque an element is. A value of 1 means that the element is fully opaque
(fully filled) while a value of 0 means transparent (invisible). You can learn more about opacity here.

.awesome {
opacity: 0.5;
}
RGBA
RGBA is not a CSS property but rather a new color model introduced in CSS3, adding the ability to specify a level of
opacity along with an RGB color value. You can learn more about RGBA here

.awesome {
background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);
}
Multiple Background Images
CSS3 allows you to apply multiple background images on an element (separated with commas). This is how people create the
parallax scrolling effect. You can learn more about multiple background images here.

body {
background: url(first_image.png) no-repeat top left,
url(second_image.png) repeat-x bottom left;
}
Browser Prefixes
CSS Browser Prefixes or CSS Vendor prefixes are a way for browser developers to add support for new CSS features before
such feature becomes fully supported by all browsers. Sample of these prefixes are '-webkit-' and '-moz'. You may check
this for more information about prefixes.

Other Goodies
You can also transition and transform your elements with CSS3. This was once only possible with JavaScript. You can read
more about transitions here and transformations here.
