    What is User Experience?
    User experience (UX) is the in-depth understanding of users’ needs, wants, pain points, values, background, goals, and
    limitations. Since any product, platform or service is useless without providing a good user experience; it should be
    the main priority of the product team to establish.
    
    
    
    5 Elements of User Experience
    Every user experience counts for it represents each user’s apparent preferences, hidden desires, and actual choices.
    Many factors can shape the end-design, but it’s the UX elements that influence the product as a whole. Knowing the users
    and understanding where they are coming from can help you achieve your goals.
    
    User - refers to a person who uses the product or a target product customer. When designing a particular product,
    system, or service, you need to wear the user hat. You need to know what they think, feel, and need; therefore,
    researching and creating personas ahead of time will help you produce more realistic content and data.
    Design - is a detailed blueprint or plan that optimizes UX to identify a market opportunity, define related problems and
    create possible solutions in the form of products and services. Through careful planning and organizing UX flow, product
    design can answer specific user needs, resolve pain points, and achieve targeted outcomes.
    Content - can be text, an icon, an image, or any information that can help users/consumers to understand the items or
    products they are viewing. It should be user-centered, valid, and action-oriented. The key is to make it simple, clear,
    and interesting to highlight a product’s usability, practicality, purpose, and efficiency.
    Context - sets the meaning, value, and purpose of the content. UX context ensures clarity and gives a personal touch to
    designs, for it builds unique stories and meaningful experiences with different types of users and settings. To create
    valid context, you need to talk or interview your prospective users.
    Product - can be a service, system, app, website, tool, or technology in the web development industry. Best products
    have great UX/UI that attract, convert, and retain users/customers. Remember, no one wants to waste time or money on bad
    and useless products because people value FUNCTIONALITY over BEAUTY, EXPERIENCE over IDEA.
    
    
    5 Reasons Why UX is Important
    People use the internet and technological gadgets all the time. They remember much of the good websites or apps they
    used as well as the bad ones. To reduce the risk `of disappointing the users and giving a product an awful reputation,
    we must bear in mind that UX matters!
    
    UX defines customer journeys, fulfills needs, and provides positive experiences.
    UX creates answers and solutions to users’ problems or frustrations.
    Content and UX are partners in compelling the users to engage, subscribe or click on any web page or application.
    A product design with powerful UX can increase UI effectivity, content relevance, and market boost.
    UX is a significant design tool that makes any user/customer loyal to the product or brand.
    
    
    Now that you learn the five UX elements and their importance, look around you and observe some of their real-life
    applications. Then, ask yourself these questions:
    
    What makes a great user experience? Why do you think so?
    What UX elements your favorite website capitalize more on? Why was it designed that way?
    How do you feel about your social media account (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram)? Does it have a good UX?
    Why do you like the UX/UI of your favorite software gaming application?
