<!-- You may notice that this time we added the line
<!doctype html> .The purpose of this line is to tell the browser that we want our document to be read in standard mode.
What this basically means is that we are using the latest accepted HTML conventions. This line should be the first line
in every HTML document you create.
<html> indicates that everything between it and its closing tag

</html> will be marked-up using HTML conventions.
The

<head> will eventually contain meta-data about the document, the external Stylesheets and JavaScript libraries that the
    document will use, and the document's title.
    The

<body> will contain the user content - everything in the document that will be visible in the browser window.
    For additional sectioning needs, we will use the <div> tag which stands for division. -->
