    ES6 Offers Block Scoping
    ES6 gives us the ability to create variable with const and let in addition to var. While var is function scoped, let and
    const are also block scoped. For example, if a let or const variable is defined inside an if-block or a loop, then it
    will not be defined outside of that block. Referring to that variable outside of the block will produce a ReferenceError
    since it is not defined.
    
    function letLoop(){
    for (let i=0; i<3; i++) { // notice we use let to define i console.log(i); // this will log 0, 1, 2 } console.log(i); //
        this will give us a ReferenceError because i is not defined outside the loop } In contrast, when we use var to
        define our iterator in a loop, then we may refer to it outside the loop. function varLoop(){ for (var i=0; i<3; i++)
        { // notice we use var to define i console.log(i); // this will log 0, 1, 2 } console.log(i); // this will log 3 }
        For variables where the value is not going to be changed, you can declare using const. If you try to update or
        change a value that was storied in a variable that was declared using 'const' , it will throw an error. For example,
        const a=15; a=a + 10; // this will throw a TypeError: Assignment to constant variable Most developers who are
        familiar with ES6 will typically use let and const and stop using var. Some of the older code base may still declare
        variables all using 'var' . For you, you should know how to use both and for us, going forward, we'll lean more
        heavily on using let and const instead of var. 
        
        Key Takeaways 
        1. Each function has access to all the variables in its parent function. 
        2. No function has access to the variables in its child functions.
        3. Your entire .js file can be thought
        of as the outermost function or 'global' scope.
        4. With ES6, we can also take advantage of block-scoping.
