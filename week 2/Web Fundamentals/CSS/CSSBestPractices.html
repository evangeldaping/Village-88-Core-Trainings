CSS Best Practices
Before you proceed further, we want to introduce a few additional best practices for HTML and CSS. Please read these
carefully as these best practices are very important for you to understand.

Best Practice #1: Avoid using too many <div> tags
    Keep a close eye on how many times you're using <div> tags. Whenever you have one element within a division, it
        means you don't need that division! For example, imagine you had a code like this

        <div>
            <h1>Word Stream</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <div class="title">
                <h3>WordStream for PPC</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="heading">
                <div class="emphasis">Drive more Profits Through PPC!</div>
            </div>
        </div>
        By looking at the code above, can you identify unnecessary divisions? Whenever you have one element inside a
        division, it means that's redundant! Think about how you can refactor the code above to make it simpler. One
        possible way to refactor the code is to do something like below

        <h1>Word Stream</h1>
        <div>
            <h3>WordStream for PPC</h3>
            <h4>Drive more Profits Through PPC!</h4>
        </div>
        Putting only one element in another element is like putting your Christmas gift in a box and then putting that box in
        another box that's slightly bigger (which means that the outer box was not necessary).
        
        Great programmers always do things with less code, and we want you to practice reviewing your code and always striving
        to do things in the most simple manner possible. Fewer lines of code -- less text -- this is always better. Please
        remember that.
        
        Now, duplicate the page below while considering what you've learned above.
        
        Best Practice #2: Avoid using too many classes over and over again
        It's a common mistake for a new front-end engineer to use a lot of classes in their html. For example, they may have:
        
        <div class='container'>
            <div class='row'>
                <p class='description'>Sample Text.</p>
                <p class='description'>Sample Text.</p>
                <p class='description'>Sample Text.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <p class="description">Sample Text.</p>
                <p class="description">Sample Text.</p>
                <p class="description">Sample Text.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <p class="description">Sample Text.</p>
                <p class="description">Sample Text.</p>
                <p class="description">Sample Text.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        As a typical rule, whenever you see things being repeated multiple times, always ask yourself, "the things that are
        being repeated, are they really necessary?" Almost always, the answer is a strong "No" and where you can refactor your
        HTML to make it cleaner. For example, do you really need a class "row" for all the division inside the division class
        container? Do you really need the class description for all the paragraphs inside the div class='row'? The answer is a
        No. You could easily make the above html code as follows:
        
        <div class="container">
            <div>
                <p>Sample Text.</p>
                <p>Sample Text.</p>
                <p>Sample Text.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Sample Text.</p>
                <p>Sample Text.</p>
                <p>Sample Text.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Sample Text.</p>
                <p>Sample Text.</p>
                <p>Sample Text.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        Best Practice #3: Don't overuse html tags un-necessarily
        Imagine that you were creating a period table in HTML and CSS.

        If you were creating this, how would you structure the elements (for element 21/22/23/24)? Would you do something like
        this?
        
        <div class='row'>
            <div class='element'>
                <p>21</p>
                <p class='name>Sc</p>
                <p>44.956</p>
            </div>
            <div class=' element'>
                <p>22</p>
                <p class='name>Ti</p>
                <p>47.867</p>
            </div>
            <div class=' element'>
                <p>23</p>
                <p class='name>V</p>
                <p>50.942</p>
            </div>
            <div class=' element'>
                <p>24</p>
                <p class='name>Cr</p>
                <p>51.996</p>
            </div>
            ...
        </div>
        Now, do you really need all the div inside div class=' row' to have a div class='element' ? Also, do you really need
                    three paragraphs? How about p class='name' ? Is there another way you could group that information using a
                    separate html tag? For example, you could minimize the number of html tags used by doing instead: <div
                    class='row'>
                <p>21
                <h2>Sc</h2>44.956</p>
                <p>22
                <h2>Ti</h2>47.867</p>
                <p>23
                <h2>V</h2>50.942</p>
                <p>24
                <h2>Cr</h2>51.996</p>
            </div>
            Note that <div class='element'> was not needed at all, plus we could remove extra p tags by utilizing headers.
                Whenever you have information that's more emphasized, instead of putting them into paragraphs, consider using
                <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc. The key is always to do with less html as possible.
        
                            When you use less html tags and less classes, the html code also becomes a lot easier to read!
        
                            Best Practice #4: Start using html tags such as <section>
                                <header>
                                    <footer>, etc.
                                        There are lots of html tags that you don't really need to use but which could be
                                        helpful, especially if your html starts having too many divs. You could, for example,
                                        consider
        
                                        <div class='header'>Header Info</div>
                                        <div class='main'>
                                            <div class='nav'>Nav Content</div>
                                            <div class='body'>Main Body Content</div>
                                        </div>
                                        <div class='footer'>Footer</div>
                                        Using <section>, <header>, and <footer>, you could structure your html as follows:
        
                                                    <header>Header Info</header>
                                                    <section class='main'>
                                                        <div class="nav">Nav Content</div>
                                                        <div class="body">Main Body Content</div>
                                                    </section>
                                                    <footer>Footer</footer>
                                                    As all websites all have a header and a footer, using <header> and <footer>
                                                            could be very helpful. <section> is also used widely. Remember
                                                                however that you don't technically need to use these html tags
                                                                as all websites could be created using plain old divs.
        
                                                                Best Practice #5: Don't have HTML class contain information
                                                                about the styles including locations
                                                                Consider the following html:
        
                                                                <div class='top_right'>
                                                                    Login Information
                                                                </div>
                                                                <div class='bottom'>
                                                                    Blog Links
                                                                    </divclass="support tag close from-rainbow">>
                                                                    <div class='top_right">
           Contact Information
        </div>
        What' s wrong with the html above? If you couldn't tell, look closely at the name of the classes. The key is that the
                                                                        html class should not have information about how things
                                                                        should look or where these elements should be placed.
                                                                        That's up to the CSS file (or whoever is creating the
                                                                        CSS file). Instead, you should give generic names and
                                                                        leave it up to the designer to decide where to put that
                                                                        information <div class='login'>
                                                                        Login information
                                                                    </div>
                                                                    <div class='blog_links'>

                                                                    <div class='contact'>
                                                                        Contact Information

                                                                    Did you know that all these 5 sites are using an exact same
                                                                    HTML page? The only file that's different for these 5 urls
                                                                    is the css file! Therefore, do not have the html file
                                                                    dictate where different content should go. It's up to the
                                                                    CSS designer whether they want to put certain information on
                                                                    the top, bottom, left, or right.
        
                                                                    Similarly, you should avoid using color name such as red,
                                                                    blue, green, etc and include them directly in the html
                                                                    class. For example,
        
                                                                    <p>Hello <span class='red'>Michael</span>
                                                                        <span>Sensei</span>.</p>
                                                                    is not a good practice. Instead, you should do something
                                                                    like this
        
                                                                    <p>Hello <span class='emphasis'>Michael</span>
                                                                        <span>Sensei</span>.
                                                                    <p>
                                                                        Best Practice #6: Avoid using html tags that dictate
                                                                        style
