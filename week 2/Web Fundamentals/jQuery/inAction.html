To get started with jQuery, go to google's hosted jQuery library and copy the link from there. This is the address we
will tell our browser to import the library from. Next, in the

<head> portion of your HTML document, or right before the ending tag for the body, include the link you just copied:

    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    Notice that what we are doing is adding a 'source' attribute to our JavaScript. We are effectively telling our page:
    "take all the code hosted at this URL and allow me to use it on this page."
