    <title>Examples of good UX designs</title>
</head>
<body>
    To understand better the concepts of user experience on design, you need to learn how to differentiate good UX practices
    from bad UX examples. But how will you know if the product has a good user experience? What are the indicators of a good
    UX design?
    
    The best way to test your idea is to talk to users. Observe them using the product, ask them questions, listen to their
    feedback and analyze their decisions. Since it’s impossible to read their minds, pay attention to their facial
    expression, tone of voice, and body language.
    
    
    
    UX Best vs. Worst Practices
    It sucks to hear from clients that your product didn’t make the cut due to UX issues. It doesn’t matter if you put in
    hundreds of hours just to build the product or feature; if the users didn’t like it, you can’t force them to use it. To
    avoid that disaster, you need to equip yourself with simple UX hacks that can save you and your project.
    
    
    
    1. UX must be clear, simple, and effortless.
    You know the UX/UI design is terrible if it gives you a massive headache. Remember, our brain interprets info to see
    patterns and understand connections. If the flow of thought is complicated and complex, then the UX fails its purpose.

    Look at the image above. Analyze the differences between the two forms and answer the questions below.
    
    Ask Yourself
    
    Why do you think the left form has great UX? Can you enumerate the good practices applied to the design?
    Why do you think the right form has the worst UX? What else can you do to improve its UX?
    Why is white space in design mandatory?
    How many clicks would you do to complete the left form? Why is it hard to use that sign-up form?
    Can you answer the form on the right without someone assisting you? Why?
    
    
    2. UX must be user-focused, detailed-oriented, and useful.
    Since our experience determines our actions and influences perceptions, the core of UX is user empowerment. Its primary
    goals are to present convenient solutions, solve problems, and make people happy.

    The image above displays both good and bad practices of user experience. Try to classify them and answer the questions
    below.
    
    Ask Yourself
    
    Can you enumerate the best practices applied to the design? How about the bad ones?
    Why do you think the search bar has a UX issue?
    Is it necessary to use different but limited colors and sizes for features, text, and icons?
    Why does design emphasis and contrast matter?
    What other icon/s should be removed or improved? Why?
    
    
    3. UX should be effective, satisfying, and appealing.
    When your gut tells you something is wrong with the UX, you need to listen to it. Our five senses are designed to absorb
    and analyze things in our surroundings. Hence, UX is effective if it gives satisfaction to the users by fulfilling their
    needs.

    Observe the two modals and identify their differences in terms of design and UX. Then, answer the questions below.
    
    Ask Yourself
    
    Why do you think the UX on the right is more effective in terms of functionality?
    Why are the CTAs or call-to-action buttons of the left modal better?
    How can color, content, font, and style influence the moods and feelings of a user?
    When can we say that the UX is beautiful and intuitive?
    Why do we need to satisfy our users?
